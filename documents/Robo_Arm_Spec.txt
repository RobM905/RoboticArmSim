Robotic arm Project Spec
Description:

As part of the Space Robotics module, students learn about the forward and inverse kinematics of a robotic arm, such as might be used on a planetary rover. 
Although the equations are taught and examples worked through, there is currently no physical robotic arm to test their solutions on.

This project is to develop a portable simulator of a 5- or 6-DoF robotic arm, that can be visualised in 3D in a web browser (using a framework such as three.js) and which can be used to try out solutions to kinematics problems. 
The arm and its environment will be visualised in a 3D window with a moveable viewpoint, and as a minimum will accept joint angles as input (for a forward kinematic solution), 
or a desired 3D target coordinate (for an inverse kinematic solution), with an indication of the end-point coordinates of the arm's effector and its distance from the desired target after movement has taken place.



Desirable additions to the basic scenario could include some or all of:

Variable arm configuration (perhaps using XML)
Sequences of joint positions and motor speeds to allow complex movements
Addition of physics engine to model collisions of arm with self or environment
Simulation of end-effector(s), e.g. simple gripper to pick up simluated "rocks"
Generalised kinematic model using D-H parameters and matrices
Calculation of torque and power during operation
